# FairTrade
FairTrade is a fair-exchange protocol mainly consists of two parts: data verification part and atomic exchange part.

The file VerificationPhaseSimulation.ipynd is written for testing  time consumption during the verification phase. \\
  Speicifically, a AES encryption/decyption is included to show the overhead caused by introducing our scheme. 
  
 Two smart contracts are also included. The DelgadoWork.sol is an implementation of baseline work. Both contracts can be implemented using the solidity online editor Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org/). The cost of functions of the contracts can be calculated through Remix.
